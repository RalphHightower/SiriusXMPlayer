# SiriusXMPlayer (Unofficial)
UNOFFICIAL Dedicated SiriusXM Windows Application 

[Download Latest version](https://github.com/TimBurris/SiriusXMPlayer/releases/latest)

# Is it Free?

Yes, this app is free, but it does not bypass SiriusXM Subscription requirements.  The App is a simple wrapper for the web player, you'll still have to sign in with your SiriusXM credentials.

# Purpose
I created this App because the Official Windows Store version is simply unreliable; consistently crashing, failing to play, claiming you are logged in somwhere else, etc.  I guess that's why it has a 1 star rating.

The SiriusXM player in the browser works so much better, but suffers from two core issues.  First, it does not respond to media keys.  So if your keyboard has Play/Pause, Next Track, and Previous Track, those buttons will be ignored by the player in the browser.

Secondly, I'm not a fan of having the player running in one of my open tabs, I prefer it to be an out-of-sight (running in background) process.

For those reasons, I created this player which does use the browser (MS Edge), but it is a dedicated instance, not utilizing a Tab in your Edge instance.

# Features
- Responds to Meida Keys (Play/Pause, Next Track, Previous Track)
- Runs in System Tray

# System Requirements
the current provided release requires 64 bit windows and Microsoft Edge WebView.  WebView can be downloaded from Microsoft: [WebView](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/#download-section)
